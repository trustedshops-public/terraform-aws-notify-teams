### Commit message format

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted.

This format leads to **easier to read commit history** and the ability to create auomated reeleases with semantic-commit.

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  │       │             │
  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: This is usually a ticket number, if available
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is optional.

Example: `feat(TPSDO-1337): added option for additional environment variables`

#### Release type per commit message

| Commit message           | Release type     |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| fix(scope): summary      | Patch Release    |
| feat(scope): summary     | Feature Release  |
| perf(scope): summary     | Breaking Release |
| BREAKING CHANGE: summary | Breaking Release |

### README Header / Footer

- The header for the README is located in [.readme-header.md](.readme-header.md). If you change it, you also need to regenerate the README
- The footer for the README is located in [.readme-footer.md](.readme-footer.md). If you change it, you also need to regenerate the README
