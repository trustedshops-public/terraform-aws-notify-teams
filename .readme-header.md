This module creates an SNS topic (or uses an existing one) and an AWS Lambda function that sends notifications to Teams using the [incoming webhooks API](https://api.teams.com/incoming-webhooks).

Start by setting up an [incoming webhook integration](https://my.teams.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/) in your Teams workspace.

Doing serverless with Terraform? Check out [serverless.tf framework](https://serverless.tf), which aims to simplify all operations when working with the serverless in Terraform.

## Supported Features

- AWS Lambda runtime Python 3.8
- Create new SNS topic or use existing one
- Support plaintext and encrypted version of Teams webhook URL
- Most of Teams message options are customizable
- Various event types are supported, even generic messages:
  - AWS CloudWatch Alarms
  - AWS CloudWatch LogMetrics Alarms
  - AWS GuardDuty Findings


## Usage

```hcl
module "notify_teams" {
  source  = "git::https://github.com/trustedshops/terraform-aws-notify-teams.git?ref=v5.0.0"

  sns_topic_name = "teams-topic"

  teams_webhook_url = "https://hooks.teams.com/services/AAA/BBB/CCC"
}
```

## Using with Terraform Cloud Agents

[Terraform Cloud Agents](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/agent.html) are a paid feature, available as part of the Terraform Cloud for Business upgrade package.

This module requires Python 3.8. You can customize [tfc-agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/tfc-agent) to include Python using this sample `Dockerfile`:

```
FROM hashicorp/tfc-agent:latest
RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get -y install python3.8 python3-pip
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/tfc-agent"]
```

## Use existing SNS topic or create new

If you want to subscribe the AWS Lambda Function created by this module to an existing SNS topic you should specify `create_sns_topic = false` as an argument and specify the name of existing SNS topic name in `sns_topic_name`.

## Examples

- [notify-teams-simple](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-notify-teams/tree/master/examples/notify-teams-simple) - Creates SNS topic which sends messages to Teams channel.
- [cloudwatch-alerts-to-teams](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-notify-teams/tree/master/examples/cloudwatch-alerts-to-teams) - End to end example which shows how to send AWS Cloudwatch alerts to Teams channel and use KMS to encrypt webhook URL.

## Local Development and Testing
